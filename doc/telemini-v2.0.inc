	TeleMini v2.0 is 0.8 inches by 1Â½ inches. It adds more
	on-board data logging memory, a built-in USB connector and
	screw terminals for the battery and power switch. The larger
	board fits in a 24mm coupler. There's also a battery connector
	for a LiPo battery if you want to use one of those.

	=== TeleMini v2.0 Screw Terminals
	
		TeleMini v2.0 has two sets of four screw terminals on the end of the
		board opposite the telemetry antenna. Using the picture
		above, the top four have connections for the main pyro
		circuit and an external battery and the bottom four have
		connections for the apogee pyro circuit and the power
		switch. Counting from the left, the connections are as follows:

	=== Connecting A Battery To TeleMini v2.0

		There are two possible battery connections on TeleMini
		v2.0. You can use either method; both feed through
		the power switch terminals.

		One battery connection is the standard Altus Metrum
		white JST plug. This mates with single-cell Lithium
		Polymer batteries sold by Altus Metrum.

		The other is a pair of screw terminals marked 'Battery
		+' and 'Battery -'. Connect a battery from 4 to 12
		volts to these terminals, being careful to match polarity.

	=== Charging Lithium Batteries

		Because TeleMini v2.0 allows for batteries other than
		the standard Altus Metrum Lithium Polymer cells, it
		cannot incorporate a battery charger
		circuit. Therefore, when using a Litium Polymer cell,
		you'll need an external charger. These are available
		from Altus Metrum, or from Spark Fun.

      	=== Using a Separate Pyro Battery with TeleMini v2.0
	
		As described above, using an external pyro battery involves
		connecting the negative battery terminal to the flight
		computer ground, connecting the positive battery terminal to
		one of the igniter leads and connecting the other igniter
		lead to the per-channel pyro circuit connection.

		To connect the negative pyro battery terminal to TeleMini
		ground, connect it to the negative external battery
		connection, top terminal 4.

		Connecting the positive battery terminal to the pyro
		charges must be done separate from TeleMini v2.0, by soldering
		them together or using some other connector.

		The other lead from each pyro charge is then inserted into
		the appropriate per-pyro channel screw terminal (top
		terminal 1 for the Main charge, bottom terminal 1 for the
		Apogee charge).

      	=== Using an Active Switch with TeleMini v2.0
	
		As explained above, an external active switch requires three
		connections, one to the positive battery terminal, one to
		the flight computer positive input and one to ground. Use
		the negative external battery connection, top terminal 4 for
		ground.

		The positive battery terminal is available on bottom
		terminal 4, the positive flight computer input is on the
		bottom terminal 3.
