these are increments 
the first type is defined by 1 divided by the number given, or also AO_K_STEP_(x) = 1/x
the second type is taking the result from before, squaring it, and then dividing it by 2
- for example: 0.00005 = (0.01**2) / 2

the steps have something to do with integration/derivation i think
for example, integral(x) = x**2 / 2

this is to help with distance and velocity calculations, and based on the tick range, it uses the step accordingly, 
since it would be difficult to calculate for each incrementation
think of it like a staircase going from height a to height b, this is to help set the number of "steps" needed

some conditional statements down here
1) first one says if the program doesnt have HAS_ACCEL or AO_FLIGHT_TEST, then it defines a macro named AO_ERROR_H_SQ_AVG with a value of 1
2) second one says that if AO_ERROR_H_SQ_AVG is non-zero (or 1 as we defined earlier), an uninitialized variable of
   type ao_v_t (int32_t) is created and named ao_error_h_sq_avg
3) third one says that if the program has HAS_ACCEL, it defines a variable named ao_error_a

Assumptions of mine:
I want to say that these are incase that the data given doesn't have everything needed and used to make work arounds, especially for 1 and 2.
for 3, it is just setting the stage for calculating error of acceleration if given.
