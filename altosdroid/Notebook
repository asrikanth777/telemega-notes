Desired AltosDroid feature list

 *) GPS satellite status tab. Monitor GPS C/N0 numbers and
    SVIDs. Provides more info before GPS lock is acquired.

 *) Channel scanning. Provide the ability to search for telemetry
    signals like AltosUI does.

 *) Random frequency selection. Provide some mechanism to input
    arbitrary radio frequencies. Could be like AltosUI which allows
    you to edit the list of frequencies and assign names to them,
    or perhaps something better.
  
 *) TM configuration from the droid

 *) Monitor-idle mode

 *) Select tracker by clicking map

 *) Auto select tracker after long delay

 *) Evaluate performance issues

 *) Merge offline/online maps into single tab with mode

 *) Make voice responses depend on selected tab

 *) Monitor TeleMega igniters

 *) Convert to four tab design:

	1) Pad

		Report out GPS status, report igniter/battery status changes

	2) Flight

		Report height, speed, az/el/range

	3) Recovery

		Report range bearing/heading (bearing if stationary,
		heading if in motion

	4) Map

		Pick out report based on current flight status
		(presume flight if in motion, recovery otherwise)

Completed features

 *) Highlight current frequency in the frequency list.

	Placed current frequency in title bar

 *) Remember most-recently-used TBT and frequency, perhaps
    auto-connect at startup.

	Done
    
 *) Re-loading flight data from .telem file to get back to
    'find my rocket' mode after shutting down the application.

	Done

 *) Imperial Units mode

	Done

 *) Select satellite imaging mode

	Done

 *) Deal with long bluetooth list. Currently, a list longer than
    the screen makes it impossible to use entries off the bottom.

	Done

 *) Pickle/unpickle state instead of reloading entire history from
    file. Current restart time is lengthy.

	Done

 *) Offline maps

	Done

 *) Multi-tracker management

	Done

 *) Provide units for age field, turn red if old

	Done

 *) TeleBT battery voltage

	Done
